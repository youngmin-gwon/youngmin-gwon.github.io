# Questions Before Project

## 1. What purpose of this project?
- I would like to use it for  jobs in the future.

- I would like to improve my design skills with flutter.

## 2. For whom?
- Potential employer
- My colleagues and friends

## 3. What content?
- About me
    - what qualities I think I have(=soft skills)
    - what I can make (not skills, results)
    - what I like (hobby would be okay, but what about values in life?)
    - who I think I am, who people around me think I am (this needs people's help like PR)

## 4. Design style?
- professional, but interactive and popping?

## 5. What feature?
- not much feature. I think I don't need payment system or posting on this portfolio
- copy to clipboard when clicking contents like email. I think it looks weird when OS deAult email pops up clicking the address.
